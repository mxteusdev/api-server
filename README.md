This is a simple API sample in Node.js with express.js based on [Google Cloud Run Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy/deploy-nodejs-service).

## Getting Started

Server should run automatically when starting a workspace. To run manually, run:

First install all the dependencies

```sh
npm i
```

```sh
npm run dev
```

To compile the project use:

```sh
npx tsc
```

Run the Nodemon server:

```sh
psx nodemon
```

Remember to start the database when running the project.
